              <br>
              
              <p>The choice of domain name depends on how you plan to use it. In most cases, it makes sense to choose one that is easy to pronounce and spell if you will be telling people about it over the phone. Above all, you should choose a name that is memorable and not confusing.</p>

              <br>
              
              <p>The time it takes to build a site depends on the complexity of the site. If you have a deadline, we will work hard to meet it. The most common cause of delay is the content (text/images) from the client.</p>

              <br>
              
              <p>Most of the time, a meeting isn't necessary and the work is completed with only discussions over phone and email. We upload our work to private websites that only clients can access. We then work with you to discuss the site and review changes. The site isn't made available to the public until it looks and works exactly as you wish.</p>

              <p>Please provide all text, photos and graphics in electronic form. For example, the output from a digital camera, Microsoft Word or a digital scanner. If this is not possible, we can help get your information ready for the website.</p>

              <br>
              
              <p>All our websites are created with search engines in mind, and all designs are compliant with search engine guidelines. It is a good idea for your website to be re-evaluated from time to time as search engines do alter their rules and algorithms. This will ensure that your site is up to date and compliant with new rules.</p>
